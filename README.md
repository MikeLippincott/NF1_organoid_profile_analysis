# NF1_organoid_profile_analysis
This repo contains analysis code of profiles generated in multiple image-based profiling repos.

- 3D image-based profiles of NF1 organoids were generated from: [NF1 3D Organoid profiling pipeline](https://github.com/WayScience/NF1_3D_organoid_profiling_pipeline)
- 2D image-based profiles of NF1 organoids were generated from: [NF1 Organoid profiling pipeline](https://github.com/WayScience/NF1_2D_organoid_profiling_pipeline)
- Cell types will be predicted using: [Cell type prediction in NF1 organoids](https://github.com/WayScience/NF1_organoid_cell_segmentation)

## Repo modules
- `0.download_data`: Download image-based profiles from the internet (not yet available)
- `1.EDA`: Exploratory data analysis of image-based profiles
